// NetRules.cs
// Remake: the Gameplay options that change how the game plays are one rule for the whole session. In a session every
// orbit's NPCs, loot and missions run in one player's game (the orbit authority, the mission runner) and the others see
// that game's result, so a rule each player picks for themselves would change with whoever runs the orbit. The host's
// (or a dedicated server's) values go to everyone in NetState (a bit mask); Settings' getters return the session's value
// while a session runs. A player host picks them with its own Gameplay options (and may change them while hosting, at
// once for everyone); a dedicated server with its command line and server settings (NetServerSettings). The options'
// rows are hidden for the other players. Options that only change what one player sees or how they steer (target lock,
// markers, cameras, dialogue, hints) stay each player's own.
