// NetRateLimit.cs
// Multiplayer, the server: how often each client may send each kind of request (NetState's server RPCs, the hit / shot /
// effect relays of NetPlayer and NetProxy, NetCrate's claims). One token bucket per client and kind: it holds `capacity`
// requests and refills `perSecond`; a request without a token is dropped silently. The limits are well above what real
// play sends (a busy orbit's 40 ships spawning at once, a held shop arrow's 5 units per frame, a battle's shots), so only a
// modified client flooding the server meets them: it is logged once a minute, and a client that keeps flooding (the
// weighted drops of a minute past KickDrops) is kicked at the next sweep (Tick). The host's own player isn't limited (it is
// the server). Validation failures that aren't floods (Reject: a hit from another orbit, a share bigger than the mission)
// are only logged, once a minute per client.
