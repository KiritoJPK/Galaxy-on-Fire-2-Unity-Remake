// PlayerHull.cs
// Remake-only debug toy (the Debug page's Ships tab, CheatsCatalog.Hulls): the player flies any ship of the game, where they
// are. Every hull the original builds a ship from (Globals::getShipGroup: ships 0-63 with a model; 50 and 53 have none, the
// Vossk freighter 13 and the race freighters 15) and the capital ships it only ever places as NPC objects: the Terran
// battleship (ship 14, TrafficPlan: 30 % of the Terran orbits with freighters), the Terran carrier and the Vossk battleship
// (Level::createStaticObject 0x4974 / 0x4a6b), the Valkyrie battlestation (level 80) and the Void's mother ship
// (station_void). The capital ships keep their turrets (TrafficPlan.BattleshipTurrets / CarrierTurrets / VosskTurrets,
// ValkyrieLevels.StationTurrets with its shield generators as scenery), riding on the hull as the player's own auto turrets:
// they shoot whatever is hostile to the player and never hit the player (NpcShip.MakePlayerTurret). Not the fighter turret of
// ships 45 / 51 (Level::createFighterTurrets is the NPCs' only: the player's Bloodstar and Rhino have a turret slot, #45).
// The hull is Session.ShipIndex (its ships.json stats, weapon mounts, save) plus, for the hulls that aren't that ship's own
// model (the race freighters and the objects outside ships.json, which fly with the battleship's stats: 100 hull, handling
// 50), the picked hull's key in PlayerPrefs; a ship bought or swapped another way drops it. Hulls the player can't normally
// own (the freighters 13 / 15, the battleship 14 and the capital ships; every other ship with a model is sold by some dealer
// (Shop.GenerateShips), lent by the story or sold by the Kaamo mechanics) never land in a hangar: the player's docking is
// refused and the story's moves into a station put the player back in their own ship (SpaceLevel.Dock, StationLevel).
// Hulls over 150 m across get a chase camera fitted to their size and are shrunk on the hangar's turntable. Nothing here is
// in the original.
