// Inventory.cs
// Plain data for what the player and the stations own (the original's Item amount fields and Station objects):
//   ItemStack         an item and an amount: a cargo stack, a mounted item (secondaries: amount = ammo), a stock row
//   StationStock  one station's shop stock, ships for sale and bar agents, kept while the station is among the last 3
//                     visited
//                     (Status+0x19c stack, Status::addStationToStack 0xb6140)
//   StoredShip        a hull parked at the Kaamo Club (Station::addShip on the storage: index, race, mods; no equipment)
