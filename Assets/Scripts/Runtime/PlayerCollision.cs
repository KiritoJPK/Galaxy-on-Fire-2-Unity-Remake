// PlayerCollision.cs
// PlayerEgo::calcCollision 0xab550 (Reference/research/ship_combat.md 2.9), on the player ship. Runs after the ship has
// moved each frame, like PlayerEgo::update, over the landmarks, then the NPC ships, then the asteroids:
// Remake: the ship is a sphere (ShipSpheres: centred on its hull, out to its farthest part) instead of a point, for the
// obstacles and the asteroids below.
//   station, jumpgate, freighters (Obstacle)   the ship is put on the surface of the volumes it is inside
//                                              (projectCollisionOnSurface) and keeps flying, so it slides along them;
//                                              camera hit() (shake 1000 ms, +-6 units); no damage
//   NPC fighters                               none: the player flies through them (they have no volumes)
//   asteroids                                  the asteroid is destroyed (damage 9999, normal death), the player takes
//                                              20 (shield -> armor -> hull), camera hit(); no push
//   the wormhole (Wormhole)                    visible and not shrinking, within 40000 units: its loop sound, the ship
//                                              pulled toward it by (40000 - d) / 256 units per 30 fps frame, camera
//                                              hit(); within 1000 units the ship is inside (PlayerEgo+0x25)
// Collision is off during the launch / arrival camera and the jump scenes (PlayerEgo+0x144, set by the level), while
// mining (PlayerEgo+0x356 with a mining phase 1-3) and once dead.
// The 1000 ms jitter of the ship model after a hit (PlayerEgo+0x328 / +0x32c, +-0.006 units) is too small to see and
// isn't reproduced.
// Remake: a phase cloak (PlayerCloak.Phasing, a mod item's attribute 104) lets the ship pass through the landmarks, the
// freighters, other players' ships and the asteroids while it is cloaked; the wormhole still pulls.
// Remake haptics: running into a landmark is a knock, then a scraping rumble while the ship slides along it; an asteroid a
// knock; the wormhole's pull a rumble that grows toward it.
