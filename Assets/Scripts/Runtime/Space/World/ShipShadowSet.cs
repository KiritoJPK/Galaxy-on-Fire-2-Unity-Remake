// ShipShadowSet.cs
// Remake: the hangar ships' soft floor shadows (HangarShipShadow), baked by "GoF2 > Build > Hangar Shadows"
// (HangarShadowsBuilder) into Resources/GoF2Station/ShipShadows: per ship assembly its hull seen from above (R the
// underside's height, G the silhouette, A a wide soft halo), the square it covers in the ship's own space (centre x / z and
// side, Unity metres at scale 1), the hull's lowest point and R's range, plus the shadow material (GoF2/HangarShadow, black). The meshes are
// imported non-readable, so a build can't rasterise them itself; the mods' ships (glTFast keeps their meshes readable)
// are baked at run time (ShipShadowBaker), the rest without an entry (the debug capital hulls) get a soft oval of their
// bounds.
