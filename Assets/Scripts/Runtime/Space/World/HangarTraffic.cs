// HangarTraffic.cs
// Remake-only: the hangar's other ships come and go (the original's parked ships never move, Level::createScene 0x17).
// The hangar starts with the original's parked ships (0..max, StationLevel). Every 12-35 s one ship either lands on a
// free parked-ship slot (a new one, picked like the parked ships: 70 % the hangar's race, else any race or pirates; the
// emptier the hangar, the likelier; parked at a random yaw like them) or takes off from its slot and leaves through
// the forcefield (HangarFlight). At most one flight is in the air at a time, the player's included, so nothing flies through
// anything: the traffic waits while the player lands or takes off, and a departing player holds over its pad while
// an NPC flight finishes (StationLevel). Never more ships than the original's parked maximum.
// Multiplayer guests (NetHangar): the other players docked here park on the slots too, by client id: one who docks flies
// in, one who takes off flies out (queued like the others: one flight at a time), one already here when this player
// arrives (or with the flights off) is simply parked; a full hangar makes room by removing a parked NPC ship. The random
// traffic never takes a guest away.
// Plain C#: StationLevel creates and ticks it (the NPC traffic not in the owned Kaamo Club, whose parked ships are the
// stored hulls; with the hangar flights off only the guests, parked without flying).
