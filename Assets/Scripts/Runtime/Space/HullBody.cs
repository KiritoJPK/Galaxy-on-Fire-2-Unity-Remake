// HullBody.cs
// Remake: an object's collision hull, made of Unity MeshColliders on its own model's meshes (HullCollision.Attach), on
// the model's root with a kinematic Rigidbody so a moving or animated hull stays cheap for PhysX. It links the colliders to
// the Target they belong to (shots: Gun) and to the Obstacle the player slides along (PlayerCollision); either may be null
// (a station is never hit, a fighter is no obstacle). The model hidden (a dead ship's, a cloaked proxy's) takes its
// colliders with it.
