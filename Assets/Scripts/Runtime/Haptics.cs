// Haptics.cs
// Remake-only: haptic feedback on the controller (the Input System's dual-motor rumble: Xbox / XInput pads, DualShock 4
// and DualSense over USB or Bluetooth, Steam Input's virtual pad) and the phone's vibration motor (PhoneVibrator, Android).
// The original has none (AbyssEngine::Engine::Vibrate is an empty stub, Globals::init switches it off). Created by
// Bootstrap and kept for the whole run.
//   output     follows InputMode: the controller last used while playing with a controller, the phone while playing by
//              touch (touch or tilt steering), nothing with keyboard and mouse; on Android a controller's go to the device's
//              own motor too (the Input System has no Android controller rumble; #73)
//   strength   Settings.HapticsIntensity (Options > Controls "Vibration", 0 = off) scales every motor and phone amplitude
//   events     Play(pulse) for one-off events (the presets below, called by the game code), Rumble(level) every frame for
//              continuous ones (ChaseCamera's explosion / boost / Liberator rumble, CutsceneCamera's rumble, scraping a
//              hull, the wormhole's pull, the Khador charge, the mining drill)
//   pause      everything stops while the game is paused (Navigation.InputHalted: menus, maps, hints, multiplayer menus),
//              the sound is paused, or the window / app loses focus; only the options' preview plays meanwhile
// The controller's motors run on the real clock (fast-forward and the time extender don't stretch a pulse); the phone gets
// one-shots (PhoneVibrator), the continuous rumble as short overlapping ones while it is strong enough to be felt.
