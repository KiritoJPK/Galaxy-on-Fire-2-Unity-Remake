// DedicatedServerLaunchers.cs
// After a Windows or Linux player build: a launcher for the dedicated server (DedicatedServer) next to the game, so a
// server starts with a double click (Windows) or one command (Linux) instead of typing the command line. The name,
// password, player limit, whether the Debug menu is allowed and the web admin (WebAdmin) are at the top of the file to edit (a rebuild keeps the values already there); it starts
// the game headless (-batchmode -nographics), online through Unity Relay and listed in the server browser. Windows: the server opens its own console window (the
// log and the commands); Linux: the terminal it runs in.
